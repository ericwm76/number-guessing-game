# Number Guessing Game

## Overview
This was our second project and first paired project at Turing. We were given the below comp to recreate. This project focused more heavily on JavaScript, and incorporate some more advanced CSS techniques, such as FlexBox. During this project, we also utilized Git, GitHub, and branches as part of the paired project workflow. The goal was to create a visually accurate representation of the comp we were given, and to produce a well function UI/UX.

## Our Project
The below screenshots are of our project. We incorporated a random number generator that the user could set custom ranges for. Our app allowed the users to enter their own names, and see them populate in different areas on the screen. Our app provides feedback via error messages if the users miss fields or provide erroneous data. It also guides the users on how their guesses compare to the number generated by our app. The app then registers a correct guess of the random number via a summary card that populates on screen.
